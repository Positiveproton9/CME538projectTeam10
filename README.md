**RATE MY RENT**

**Overview**

Rate My Rent is a data-driven pproject designed to help renters assess whether the price they are paying for an apartment is fair based on key factors like neighborhood, size, and amenities.By utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to provide a reliable rental price prediction tool that is particularly useful for international students and anyone looking to make informed rental decisions in Toronto.

**Features**

Data Collection: The project collects rental listings from sources like rentals.ca, Zillow, and the `[TRREB](https://github.com/Positiveproton9/CME538projectTeam10/blob/main/TRREB/TRREB_data_raw.csv)`.

Data Processing: Data is cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values, normalizing features, and creating new features based on apartment characteristics and location.

Machine Learning: Two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest were trained on the dataset to predict rental prices based on user input and see which model was better.
User Input: Renters can input key details like apartment size, number of rooms, and neighborhood to receive an estimated fair rental price.
